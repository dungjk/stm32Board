On bluepill I have tested connection to ESP8266 and all is working.
All sensors when not connected shows about 100 degrees, that is probably OK.
I have connected SD card to it, and with original bootloader 
I can flash some code on bluepill.
I can send GCODE to SD card.

If you realy think you need bootloader, you can contact me over email
